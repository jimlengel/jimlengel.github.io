    <h1>Videography Techniques</h1>
    <p>Creating a short movie can be done well if you follow a few tips. Here are some ideas with illustrations that may help you.</p>
    <h2 class="header">Techniques with Illustrations:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Start strong. Start with an opening shot that introduces your video.<br>
          <img src="start-strong.png" width="546" height="360" alt="opening shot">
        <li>Follow the action. Be as close to the action as possible. The first image is a great shot, but the second image is closer to the action.<br>
          <img src="basque_dancers.jpg" width="546" height="405" alt="wide shot"><br>
           <img src="basque_dancers-cu.png" width="546" height="405" alt="close up shot">
        </ol>

    <h2 class="header">Other Sources</h2>
    <p>This site from <a href="http://www.desktop-documentaries.com/videography-tips.html">Desktop Documentaries</a> gives a great list and a tutorial video that is helpful.</p>
    <p>A note about the HTML on Desktop Documentaries... The site uses CSS effectively to format the content. It uses numbered lists, headers, and bold fonts. It has an embedded video, which is great. However, the page is filled with ads, which is a little annoying.</p>
