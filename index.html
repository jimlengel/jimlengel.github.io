  <div class="subheading">SUMMARY</div>

  <div class="bodytext">Before transitioning into web development via Dev Bootcamp, I had been teaching for 13 years. For the last 5 years, I taught programming and I managed the school's maker space. Before I was a teacher, I worked in front-end development, making web pages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also configured proprietary software for a consulting company for 2 years. I have always thrived in figuring out "why doesn't this work?" and "how can I make this better?"
